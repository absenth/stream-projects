#+title: Project ToDo List:

* Functions and Commands *
- weather command
  https://github.com/briandowns/openweathermap
- CRUD Commands
  - NewCommand
  - ListCommands
  - DeleteCommand
  - UpdateCommand
  - CRUD Commands should pull from some kind of DB (or csv)

  This will require OBS Webhook interfact maybe?
